Let me introduce myself.


## Value Proposition:
**Crowdfunding Insights** is a web application that provides nonprofits such as [Kiva] (https://www.kiva.org/about) with a detailed analysis of their outreach efforts, lending partners, and recipients. 

This product provides thoughtful analysis of their critical data and tools to help simplify their outreach efforts to partners and borrowers, helping lenders understand their target communities thoughtfully, allowing them to maximize their efforts, make better informed decisions, and help set investment priorities.


## Key Features:
* Allow the user to analyze and filter loan distribution by theme category, region, country, theme, sector, activity, expected duration, and partners.

* Provide the user with poverty level based lending suggestions by analyzing the multidimensional poverty index(MPI) of regions and external poverty resources including:
	*  [**World Development Indicators**] (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators)
	*  [**Prevalence of Unemployment**] (https://datatopics.worldbank.org/jobs/)

* Allow the user to analyze the geolocations of the loan distribution and needs per theme category, activity, borrowing intensity (amount, frequency).

* Provide recommendations on what lender Kiva should approach with a funding need based on a given region, amount, expected duration of the loan, and category.
